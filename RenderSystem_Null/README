This is the Null render system for Ogre from https://bitbucket.org/rride_a/ogre-null-rendersystem/ all credits to the original author :) 
If you use it from there be sure to check out the correct branch where his changes are as one branch is the original code that wont build agains 1.7.x Ogre.

How to include in your ogre build:

* When you are buildin Ogre SDK copy this folder into /RenderSystems
* add_subdirectory(RenderSystem_Null) to the bottom of /RenderSystems/CMakeLists.txt
* build ogre as normal

-- Note: You can propably make this build without building ogre at the same time, 
   but you'll have to do some modification to the CMakeLists.txt of this project!
